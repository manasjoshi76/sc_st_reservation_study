This study explores the efficacy of reservations in Maharashtra for Scheduled Castes (SCs, communities, historically marginalized by the traditional caste hierarchy. 
Despite constitutional mandates and affirmative action initiatives, SCs in India including the state of Maharashtra, still encounter significant socio-economic challenges. 
Through statistical analysis of census data of years 2001 and 2011, this research analyzed the impact of reservations on the social standing of SCs. 
The results indicate that despite the existence of reservations, there has been marginal progress in the socio-economic condition of SCs. 
Nonetheless, the study highlights the critical role of educational reservations in addressing this issue.
